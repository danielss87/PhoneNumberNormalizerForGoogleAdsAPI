There was an error during the installation of the pandas library, which would make me need a special attention when running a specific code.

The error was the following:

  WARNING: The script f2py.exe is installed in 'C:\Users\Win10\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python311\Scripts' which is not on PATH.
  Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.



ChatGPT explanation about this error was the following:
The warning you received indicates that a script (f2py.exe, which is part of the numpy package) was installed in a directory that is not included in your system's PATH environment variable. This means that while pandas and its dependencies have been installed correctly, you might not be able to run f2py.exe directly from the command line unless you add the directory to your PATH.

What is f2py?
f2py (Fortran to Python interface generator) is a part of numpy and is used for connecting Fortran code with Python. If you don't plan on using Fortran code, this warning is not critical, and pandas should work perfectly fine.
